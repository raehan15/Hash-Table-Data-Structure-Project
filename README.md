# Hash-Table-Data-Structure-Project

Dive into the intricate world of data structures and search algorithms with my C++ project, a comprehensive exploration of hashing and binary tree methodologies. This project is a fascinating journey through text processing and analysis, leveraging the strengths of both HashTables and BinaryTrees to manage and analyze large volumes of text data efficiently.
At the core of the project lies the HashTable class, designed with meticulous attention to detail. It employs a custom hash function and dynamic resizing through rehashing, ensuring optimal performance even as data grows. The insertion and search operations are finely tuned for handling text data, making the class an ideal tool for managing word counts across multiple documents.
Complementing the HashTable, the BinaryTree class presents a contrasting yet equally effective approach to managing data. With its ability to perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals, the BinaryTree offers a different perspective on data processing, particularly in terms of search efficiency and data organization.
The project's highlight is its real-world application in processing textual data from files. It reads, filters, and normalizes content, storing each word in both the HashTable and BinaryTree, thus offering a dual-view into the data's structure. This dual implementation not only serves as a practical demonstration of these structures but also provides a comparative analysis of their performance.
An intriguing aspect of this project is its interactive query processing feature, allowing users to input search queries and observe the results in real time. This interactive component makes the project not just a demonstration of technical prowess but also a user-friendly tool for text analysis.
In essence, this project is a bridge between theoretical data structures and practical application, offering insights into how different approaches can be harnessed to manage and analyze data effectively. It stands as a testament to my ability to implement complex algorithms and solve real-world problems, embodying a journey where data meets algorithmic sophistication in the realm of text processing.
